# pidomohome
This repository includes the code which has been used in the creation of a home automation system, which is described on pidomohome.org webpage. This is the result of a research project, of which tutor has been Mireia Dosil Bonmat√≠ (mdosil.cat), who works in Institut de Vilafant teaching maths. 

This project describes the design and construction of a home domotic system. The system consists of an Arduino board that collects data from sensors (as for example temperature, humidity and luminosity sensors), processes it and triggers some control actuators. The board is connected to a Raspberry Pi device that interacts with the system and at the same time sends the data to the open source openHAB platform allowing real time data visualization. Besides, this equipment also includes an anti-thef security system, controlled by BOSH AMAX 3000, a central alarm processor, also connected to the Raspberry Pi board.

Moreover, the system is able to send alarms to a mobile phone to warn the user of possible fire or flooding catastrophes.

Finally, this research work also explores the analysis of the collected data in order to extract conclusions and rules that will allow the system to perform some autonomous decisions and to act in an intelligent way.
